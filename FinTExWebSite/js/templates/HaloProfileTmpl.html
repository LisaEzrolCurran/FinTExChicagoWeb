                The founders of Halo Investing have one simple objective: revolutionize the world of investing by introducing a new generation of financial advisory services and doing so in a way that puts impact before profits.
                </br></br>
                At first glance, Jason Barsema and Biju Kulathakal seem like unlikely partners to take on such a bold mission. Barsema came from a traditional asset management role while Kulathakal was a serial entrepreneur. But the two hit it off immediately when they first met in 2014 and the idea for Halo Investing was born on the third time they got together.
                </br></br>
                Barsema was working at the time as a relationship manager in Private Banking for Credit Suisse. Managing portfolios for ultra-high net worth individuals, he was struck by the fact that investors with smaller portfolios didn’t have access to the structured notes that played such an important role in his portfolios. Structured notes seek to deliver a consistent stream of returns while providing downside investment protection, two mandates that were crucial for his clients. That being said, Barsema also recognized that structured notes came with their own set of issues beyond accessibility, such as high fees, lack of liquidity, and issuer risk. Not to mention, the technology associated with investing in structured notes was suboptimal at best.
                </br></br>
                Kulathakal saw the potential in this idea given his extensive derivatives and entrepreneurial experience as the co-founder of RedBox and founder of Trading Block, an online options brokerage for active retail traders. Together, Barsema and Kulathakal set out to change how the world invests by creating much more efficient structured notes, called “Halos,” that are not only fee-friendly, but also provide investors liquidity and remove the dreaded bank issuer risk. The major revolution, however? Barsema and Kulathakal say it’s about being the first to provide access to income and protective investing to the very people who need it the most: the everyday investor.
                </br></br>
                “Investors today are typically offered a limited set of investment choices that don’t reflect the true needs of 99% of people,” says Barsema. “Long or short, growth or value, equity or debt: these are all inflexible asset classes that fail to address fundamental investment objectives. Investors desire stable returns while seeking to limit risk. With Halo, we can actually help people achieve their goals.”

                <b><i>   The 4th Generation of Investing is Born </b></i>
            </p></br>

            <p style="font-size: 24px;">
                Barsema and Kulathakal see Halo as the 4th generation of investment services, designed to offer mainstream investors the kinds of portfolio protection previously available to only the most wealthy individuals. Halo is blazing the trail for protective investing.
                </br></br>
                Previously, investment products and services targeted at the retail investor focused on offering streamlined cost structures and improved flexibility. Mutual funds in the 70’s and ETFs in the 90’s improved upon the actively picked portfolios of the 50’s and 60’s by letting individual investors more easily invest in a portfolio of stocks.  However, these methods suffer from the “sequence of returns risk” dilemma. Simply put, while a stock market such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, may have average returns of roughly 7.5% when measured since inception, results are “lumpy” with big returns over short time frames that are followed by other periods of little or no gain such as the “Lost Decade” of 2000-2009. For an investor that is facing retirement or other important life events, this can make investing precarious because it’s impossible to know exactly when you’ll need to access your investment savings. People wishing to retire in 2008 found this lesson out the hard way.
                </br></br>
                Halo seeks to solve this dilemma by offering investment services that seek consistent, income-oriented returns with downside protection. Utilizing listed options that clear through OCC, the central clearinghouse for all U.S. equity options, Halo is able to offer investment services that Halo contends are simpler and safer for everyone, including even the most experienced investors.
                </br></br>
                “Halo seeks to provide the returns that the largest investors get from products offered by banks”, according to Kulathakal, “but they do so by using listed options and this delivers the dual benefit of lower costs coupled with lower counterparty risk. Halos are the best of both worlds.”
                </br></br>
                Halo has successfully launched with two investment offerings, distributed via an innovative new platform that the Halo team says will change how investors engage and interact with the financial markets. Barsema says that “while the Halo services will definitively change how the future invests, it’s our team, innovation and technology that makes us defensible.” Halo will work with RIAs (registered investment advisors) to offer the Halo services to their clients. RIAs have a high degree of sophistication, and are eager to offer the Halo investment services which not only differentiates them from the competition, but seeks to provide their customers the income and protection they are looking for, but yet so hard to find.

            </br>
            <p style="font-size: 24px;">
                Barsema and Kulathakal are seeing strong demand for Halo, but their commitment goes further. A recent visit to the Halo office revealed the #1 Core Value written on their wall: “Impact before Profits.” While the sales commission on structured notes can be 5-7% charged upfront, Halo takes pride in not only creating a game-changing solution, but also charging a fraction of what structured notes charge. Halo believes that everyone deserves downside protection in their portfolio and they strive to deliver that with low fees and transparency. The beginning of the 4th generation of investing is that simple.
