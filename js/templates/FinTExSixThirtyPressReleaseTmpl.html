    <b>CHICAGO, IL and ST. LOUIS, MO – May 12, 2016 – </b>
    
    FinTEx, a Chicago based not-for-profit growing the FinTech ecosystem in the Midwest, and SixThirty, a leading FinTech Accelerator based in St. Louis, are pleased to announce a partnership to provide greater connectivity and shared resources for innovators in the region. "There's an amazing amount of activity and innovation happening in financial technology and services across the Midwest," says Jason Henrichs, co-founder of FinTEx and a Midwesterner who spent his career innovating on the coasts, "but our geographic dispersion and heads down nature can make us less visible than Silicon Valley, New York or London."  “SixThirty's mission is attract the most innovative and promising FinTech ideas from across the globe, and work with like-minded corporate partners to mentor & grow them to great businesses.  Our relationship with FinTEx in Chicago expands our community of corporate partners and extends our ability to add value to our portfolio companies,” added Atul Kamra, Managing Partner of SixThirty.
</br></br>
    As part of the partnership, SixThirty portfolio companies will spend time in Chicago meeting with mentors, investors and potential partner companies. FinTEx and SixThirty will also provide programming to both communities as they seek to expand the FinTech ecosystem.
